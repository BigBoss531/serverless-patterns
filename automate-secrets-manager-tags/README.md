# Auto-tag creator's username to AWS Secrets Manager entries

Implements automatic tagging of AWS Secrets Manager entries with the creator's username. When users authenticated via AWS IAM Identity Center create secrets, their username is automatically added as a tag. This enables easier ownership tracking and management of secrets across the organization.

Eventbridge rule is configured to look for CreateSecret events to invoke a Lambda function to tag the secret with the creator's username.

# Deployment Instructions

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
