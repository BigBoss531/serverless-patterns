            "This serverless pattern creates an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint that directly integrates with Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to read messages from a queue.",
            "Users can simply call the GET method of the invoke URL to interact with the SQS queue. The invoke URL supports query string parameters such as MaxNumberOfMessages, VisibilityTimeout, and AttributeName to customize the output.",
            "This pattern is particularly useful for frontend applications that need to interact with SQS via HTTPS protocol to read messages from the queue. It eliminates the need for AWS SDK integration, as requests to SQS can be made through simple HTTP calls.When implementing this pattern, please consider the AWS API Gateway and AWS SQS quotas to ensure compliance with the service limits."
